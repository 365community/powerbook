# Power Book


"Power Book" is an open-source project, a book written by D365 Ambassadors. It is about Microsoft Power Platform and related technologies, and the aim is to bring a new book every year.

It will be available free for the community as soft copies, and hard copies will be available to buy. We will encourage reader donations and transfer those to some charity.

# How to get involved?
We invite, love and encourage ambassadors to join this project. Here are a few guidelines to start:

   1.  We encourage you to contribute as a writer and reviewer (write a topic and also review someone's work), but you can choose to take one of these if you prefer. The same way you can decide to review more than one topics.
  
   2.  Confirm your topic and an abstract (by the end of March 2020 ideally).
  
   3. You can suggest your topic based on your experience; your writing can be: 
          
          - A recipe for doing something (technology)
          
          - How to adopt a technology or get started with something (strategy)
          
          - Best practices and tips
          
          - Something else
    
   4.  Once your topic has been confirmed for the book, you can start working on your idea
  
   5.  Your topic can be of any length, but we suggest between 5 and 10 pages (including any graphics) is reasonable
  
  6.  We will communicate a channel or group for closer coordination
